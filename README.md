# jsPsychBackendStart
Clone this repository for a starting point for my tutorial on turning your jsPsych experiment into a 
Node.js application (with a bit of help from Express and Mongoose) and deploying it to Heroku. 

You can access the <a href = "https://floating-oasis-6903.herokuapp.com" target = "new"> live demo</a> on heroku, or read the series of tutorials on how to node-ify (sorry, couldn't resist) your experiments on <a href = "http://web-psychometrics.com/tutorial1.html" target = "new">my website</a>.

<strong>NOTE!</strong>
The tutorial is work in progress. If you want a preliminary .txt version of the first steps, throw me an e-mail. I'm hoping to finish it in a week or two.
